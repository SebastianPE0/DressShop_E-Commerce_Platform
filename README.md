# 🛒 DressShop E-Commerce Platform

## 📖 Description
**DressShop** is a fully functional **E-Commerce platform** designed to sell clothing products. The platform is built using a **microservices architecture**, where each domain operates independently and communicates through APIs.

The system integrates authentication via **AWS Cognito**, ensuring secure access. It also includes **DevOps automation**, where every change triggers an **automatic deployment**, updating the corresponding microservices running on **AWS EC2** instances.

This project follows a **scalable and distributed approach**, ensuring high availability and performance.
